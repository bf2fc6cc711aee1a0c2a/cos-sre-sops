# Disaster recovery

Most of the service data is stored in a database, some of it in a secrets manager. All state is managed from the control plane component that's running in APP Interface:

https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/data/services/managed-connectors/namespaces/managed-connectors-production.yaml

The database must be setup in a way that satisfies the data service continuity requirements. Same applies for the secretes manager.

To recover the service after a data loss,
1. use the database service (e.g. AWS RDS) data recovery mechanism,
2. use the secrets manager (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager) data recovery mechanism and
3. re-start the control plane component.

General instructions for managing service comoopments through APP Interface can be found here:

## Data loss impact

In case of a complete data loss, all connector configurations are lost and need to be recreated by the user.
