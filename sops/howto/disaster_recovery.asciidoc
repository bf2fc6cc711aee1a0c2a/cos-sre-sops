# Disaster recovery

Most of the service data is stored in a database, some of it in a secrets manager. All state is managed from the control plane component that's running in APP Interface.

The database must be setup in a way that satisfies the data service continuity requirements. Same applies for the secrets manager.

## Steps to recover the service 

To recover the service after a data loss:

1. Use the database service (e.g. AWS RDS) data recovery mechanism,
2. Use the secrets manager (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager) data recovery mechanism and
3. Restart the control plane component.

NOTE: To perform these steps, you need to contact an AppSRE IC to carry it out.

## Data loss impact

In case of a complete data loss, all connector configurations are lost and need to be recreated by the user.
